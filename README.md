`secprac` is a platform to create cyber security practice games for Linux systems similar to the <a href="https://www.uscyberpatriot.org/">Cyber Patriot competition</a>.

This is the web server which will host the front-end and API.

See client to run on the practice machines at <a href="https://github.com/blueberry-jam/secprac-client">blueberry-jam/secprac-client</a>.

`secprac` is *very* WIP (Work In Progress).
